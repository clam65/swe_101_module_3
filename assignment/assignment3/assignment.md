# SWE101: Programming Fundamentals

## Assessment 03 HTML-CSS Intermediate - OPTION 1

### Case Background

The previous two assessments provided you with a holistic understanding of your company’s vision of a digital platform that merges finance with aesthetics. Your recent success in enhancing the visual appeal of the platform resonates positively with the board. However, now there’s another challenge on the horizon.

As your company steps into the more complex domains of personal finance, the company realizes the necessity of providing its users with dynamic financial portfolios. Investors and potential clients have shown significant interest in a digital space where they can visualize their investments and financial assets in a comprehensive manner. With the market constantly in flux, having an adaptable and dynamic table is paramount.

Given the overwhelming data these tables will handle, it's crucial that they not only convey the necessary information but also do so in a format that's visually pleasing and easily navigable. The challenge here isn't just to represent data but to do it in a way that reflects the brand's commitment to sophistication and user-centric design.

You've already made a mark by making data aesthetically pleasing. Now, it's about adding layers of complexity without overwhelming the user. With your company set to launch its 'Digital Investment Wing', your role as a data analyst in this new venture is more important than ever.

### Objective

Your expertise as a data analyst will be judged not just on data accuracy but on how you bridge the gap between intricate financial data and user-friendly design.

Dive deep into the vast ocean of data and emerge with a design that speaks the universal language of simplicity and elegance.
